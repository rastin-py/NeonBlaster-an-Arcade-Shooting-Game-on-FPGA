# NeonBlaster-an-Arcade-Shooting-Game-on-FPGA
An arcade game implemented in VHDL as an assignment for Digital Systems Analysis & Design course at the University of Guilan, Department of Computer Engineering, presented in Fall 2023 by [Dr. Mahdi Aminian](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YVxXqIAAAAAJ&hl=en).

This program was tested on Cyclone® V FPGA using Intel Quartus Prime.

# How to run

1. Complile the design. It should take about 10-15 minutes.
2. Program the FPGA using programmer in tools tab.
